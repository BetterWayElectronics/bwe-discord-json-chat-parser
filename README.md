## üìÅ Usage

1. Extract your entire cache using Nirsoft's ChromeCacheView app
2. Place all your exported files in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python bwe_discord_parser.py
```
4. If an `Output/` folder already exists, you'll be prompted to:
   - **(R)** Rescan and regenerate all output files
   - **(S)** Search within existing HTML files
5. Transcripts will be saved in the `Output/` folder as `.html` files.
6. A `stats.txt` summary will also be created with useful information such as:
   - Total files processed
   - Types of files
   - Unique channel IDs
   - All unique participants

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

Modify the `SETTINGS` dictionary at the top of the script to change behavior:

```python
SETTINGS = {
    "display_mode": 1,         # 1 = username, 2 = username/global_name, 3 = username/global_name/id
    "embed_images": False,     # If True, show attachments as links. If False, embed them as <img>
    "use_full_timestamp": False, # If True, use ISO timestamp. If False, show human-readable format
    "order_ascending": True    # If True, sort oldest to newest. If False, keep default order
}
```
